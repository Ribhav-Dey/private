The opposition comes days after another prominent proxy adviser, Glass Lewis & Co.,\\n\\n\\nrecommended investors vote down the Musk remuneration plan.The award value was considered\\n\\n\\noutsized from the start and it has failed to accomplish certain of the boards stated objectives from\\n\\n\\n2018, ISS said. Some investors may find the boards argument compelling, that it would be unfair for\\n\\n\\nMusk not to receive the award. However, the concerns raised, both back in 2018 and in the interim,\\n\\n\\nhave not been sufficiently mitigated, particularly given that the board has effectively only offered\\n\\n\\nshareholders an all or nothing option in this vote.Musks compensation has been hotly contested this\\n\\n\\nyear. In January, a Delaware judge struck down the pay package, saying the carmakers board\\n\\n\\nwasnt fully transparent with shareholders when they crafted the deal. Directors are asking investors\\n\\n\\nto vote on it a second time at Teslas June 13 annual meeting to demonstrate shareholders still back\\n\\n\\nthe plan, which could aid in a legal appeal of the decision.Proxy firms such as ISS often have sway\\n\\n\\nover shareholders, especially large institutions that hold stock in passive funds. However, the proxy\\n\\n\\nadviser and Glass Lewis both recommended shareholders reject the Musk pay deal when it was\\n\\n\\nvoted on the first time in 2018. About three-quarters of investors still supported the package.The\\n\\n\\noutcome of the vote is only advisory. Though a loss would be a major embarrassment to Teslas\\n\\n\\nboard and to its top executive. Musk has also threatened to build products outside of Tesla if he cant\\n\\n\\nincrease his equity holdings in the company, something the pay deal would allow him to do.Teslas\\n\\n\\nboard has mobilized to try to gain shareholder support for the measure. Tesla board chair Robyn\\n\\n\\n                                                            Page 1\\n---\\n                                                    News Content\\n\\n\\nDenholm has been contacting large institutional investors, and Tesla has published a number of ads\\n\\n\\non X, formerly Twitter. Directors also hired a strategic adviser who helped set up a Vote Tesla\\n\\n\\nwebsite, which argues reinstating the pay package supports shareholders rights.Story\\n\\n\\ncontinuesAdditionally, the website urges investors to vote in support of a proposal on moving Teslas\\n\\n\\narticles of incorporation to Texas from Delaware. The company already moved it corporate\\n\\n\\nheadquarters to Texas in 2021. In its report, ISS said cautionary support for the measure is\\n\\n\\nwarranted, as its not readily apparent that the rights of shareholders would be materially harmed by\\n\\n\\nthe move.ISS recommended voting for the reinstatement of Tesla board members Kimbal Musk,\\n\\n\\nElon Musks brother, but against James Murdoch.Both reports followed an open letter, written by a\\n\\n\\ncoalition of shareholders that hold a small portion of Teslas stock, that argued investors should\\n\\n\\noppose the pay deal.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYes, Walmart Store Managers\\n\\n\\nReally Can Make $500,000 a YearDisney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on\\n\\n\\nTrackThe Secret Ozempic Recipe Behind Novos Race to Boost SuppliesWhy Dave & Busters Is\\n\\n\\nTransforming Its Arcades Into CasinosIsraels Military Ramp-Up Threatens Another Lost\\n\\n\\nDecade©2024 Bloomberg L.P.View comments\\n\\n\\n(Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services recommended investors vote against ratifying the pay\\n\\n\\nplan of Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the electric carmaker\\'s June 13 annual meeting, calling the award\\n\\n\\nvalue \"outsized.\"In a report sent by a representative late on Thursday the proxy adviser also\\n\\n\\nrecommends votes against Tesla director James Murdoch, but recommended votes for director\\n\\n\\nKimbal Musk and for the company\\'s proposed move to change its state of incorporation to Texas\\n\\n\\nfrom Delaware.(Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)View comments\\n\\n\\nTeslas board is practically begging shareholders to approve CEO Elon Musks $45 billion pay\\n\\n\\npackage at next months annual meeting, but not everyone is onboard and now the EV maker is on\\n\\n\\n                                                          Page 2\\n---\\n                                                     News Content\\n\\n\\nthe defensive.In a 71-page report published over the weekend, proxy adviser Glass Lewis\\n\\n\\nencouraged shareholders to vote against Musks pay package, in part because of its sheer size and\\n\\n\\nthe dilutive effect on current shareholders that would take place if Musk exercised his stock options.\\n\\n\\nThe proxy adviser, which gives recommendations to institutional investors on how to vote at annual\\n\\n\\nshareholder meetings, also said it was concerned about Musk being distracted from his focus on\\n\\n\\nTesla because of responsibilities at his other ventures, including social media company X.Tesla shot\\n\\n\\nback at the proxy adviser in a Thursday letter titled What Glass Lewis Got Wrong About Tesla. In\\n\\n\\nresponse to Glass Lewis concerns over the skyrocketing value of Musks shares, his focus and\\n\\n\\ncommitment to Tesla, and the excessive size of his compensation, the EV maker repeatedly points\\n\\n\\nto the more than $735 billion in value Tesla has gained in under six years.Moreover, the company\\n\\n\\nwrote that giving Musk his multi-billion-dollar payday was the right thing to do.Tesla believes it\\n\\n\\nshould abide by its commitment to Elon just as Elon delivered on this commitment to Tesla. A deal is\\n\\n\\na deal. That is the fair and ethical thing to do, the letter reads.Musks pay package was originally\\n\\n\\napproved by shareholders in 2018 but was struck down by a Delaware judge who, in part, cited\\n\\n\\nconcerns over the independence of Teslas board of directors when it approved the compensation\\n\\n\\nplan. In April, the company said it would once again put Musks pay package to a vote at Junes\\n\\n\\nannual meeting. It is also asking shareholders to approve the company moving its incorporation to\\n\\n\\nTexas from Delaware, a proposal that came after Musks pay package was voided by the judge in\\n\\n\\nJanuary.Although company proposals often pass with overwhelming numbers at the annual\\n\\n\\nshareholder meeting, some large investors are opposed. On Wednesday, the California Public\\n\\n\\nEmployee Retirement System (CalPERS) said it would vote against the pay package. Last week, a\\n\\n\\ngroup of investors including the New York City pension funds also recommended shareholders\\n\\n\\nwithhold support from the proposal, Fortune reported.Still, Tesla has pushed hard to convince\\n\\n\\nshareholders to approve the pay proposal at the June annual meeting, including through\\n\\n\\nadvertisements, a website, and a video from board chair Robyn Denholm. Musk, himself, is offering\\n\\n\\n                                                            Page 3\\n---\\n                                                      News Content\\n\\n\\na tour of the companys Texas production lines for the Cybertruck and Model Y to a dozen\\n\\n\\nshareholders who vote yes on his pay package.Story continuesTesla did not immediately respond to\\n\\n\\nFortune\\'s request for comment.In the EV makers letter filed Thursday, it emphasized that approving\\n\\n\\nMusks pay is appropriate for the billions in value growth he has helped the company achieve.Elon\\n\\n\\nwas fully prepared to earn nothing if he failed stockholders, the letter read.
